•	Mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school which cannot be rescheduled.<br>

•	If needed, the student must provide additional documentation substantiating the reason for the absence with the filled form of absence that is satisfactory to the instructor, within one week of the last date of the absence.<br>
•	Each faculty member will refer to the attendance policy, which will be stated in the course syllabus and shared at the first class meeting. Certain courses may have more stringent attendance policies. Students should be aware of differences and plan accordingly.
•	When the number of absences exceeds 15 % with no excuse of the scheduled classes, the faculty may issue a failing grade (DN) for the student.<br><br>
•	
<strong>Procedures:</strong><br><br>
•	The student is responsible for providing satisfactory evidence to the instructor concerning the reason for absence.<br>
•	If the instructor does not accept the student's excuse the student can take the case to the college dean. If rejected and the policy of absence is applicable the student may seek the Student Affairs help. <br>
•	Absences should not exceed 15 % of the lectures and laboratory sessions specified for the course. <br>
•	Faculty member will keep a weekly record of attendance for each student.<br>
•	When an absence is unavoidable, a student should contact the instructor or the College Dean. Documentation may be required.

<h3>Course Schedules</h3><br>

<strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>

Alfaisal University is devoted to providing the best teaching and learning environment for both students and faculty members<br><br>

<strong>SCHEDULING COMMITTEE</strong><br><br>
Scheduling Committee members shall be as follows: Dean of Admission and Registration
The registrar
A faculty-member representative from each college that has been nominated by their college's dean
before the beginning of each semester.<br><br>
The goal of the committee will be to prepare a schedule that optimally allows students to register in their required classes as well as to explore a variety of elective classes in a timely manner. Moreover, the
schedule should permit faculty members the opportunity to pursue research in their respective disciplines.<br><br>

<strong>Policy and procedure:</strong><br><br>

<strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</strong><br>
Scheduling committee members, faculty members and instructors are requested to keep the following
guiding principles in mind when managing, supporting, scheduling or using classrooms:<br><br>
•	The assignment of classrooms and labs to individual colleges or departments is not permanent, the assignment may change as the needs, priorities and demands of the college or university
change.<br>
•	Final exams have scheduling priority over all other activities that require the use of classrooms.<br>
•	With appropriate notification, the Office of the Registrar is authorized to reschedule classes and final exams in any available general purpose classroom to accommodate the broader academic
needs of the university.<br>
•	Classes are planned equitably across all days of the week and all hours of the day to fully utilize available classroom space and to minimize class overlaps.<br>
•	Large classrooms will be assigned to classes that efficiently utilize the available seats.<br>
•	Departments are responsible for accommodating the special needs of faculty, instructors and students while not impinging upon the overall class schedule.<br>
•	Each college is responsible for appointing a scheduling representative to interact with the Office of the Registrar. All scheduling requests must be made through the representative only.<br>
•	Office of Registrar approval must be obtained in order to change a class day, time or classroom.<br>
•	Requesting schedule changes after the start of the preregistration period will not be permitted.<br>
Exceptions will be made for only the most necessary of circumstances. In such a case, approval from both the College Dean and the Dean of Admission and Registration must be obtained.<br>
 
•	Schedule changes will not be accepted once classes begin.<br>
•	The scheduling process for the upcoming fall semester will begin during the spring semester of the current academic year.<br><br>

<strong>PROCESS OVERVIEW</strong><br><br>

The scheduling process for classes usually starts one week before the beginning of classes of the preceding semester as follows:<br><br>

•	The Office of the Registrar calls for a meeting that involves scheduling committee members to discuss related matters.<br>
•	All colleges communicate their needs to college of science for elective courses.<br>
•	Colleges plan their overview schedules, and schedule classes in their assigned classrooms.<br>
•	Colleges' representatives are to submit their colleges' schedules to Office of the Registrar.<br>
•	Office of the Registrar verifies that the submission of colleges schedules adhere to the scheduling policy, and requests for the non-adhering classes to be changed.<br>
•	Office of the Registrar imports the schedules into the system. During this stage, no changes to be made to the schedules.<br>
•	Colleges review the imported schedules, and may request for necessary changes before the final schedule is out for students.<br>
•	Colleges, scheduling committee, and Office of the Registrar work together to resolve any remaining issues.<br>
•	All the above steps must be completed within the following specified times:<br><br>

Agreements made during the scheduling committee's meetings are documented and shared with the committee members, the Dean of Admission and Registration and all college Deans.<br><br>

<strong>Class Meeting Time</strong><br><br>

Each college and the UPP must distribute its classes over all possible days and hours while taking the below listed rules into consideration.

<br><br>


<ul>

•	Classes must fall in one of the two following patterns:<br>
•	Sun – Tue – Thu for one hour and/or two hour sessions.<br>
•	Mon – Wed for one hour and a half or three hour sessions.<br>
 
•	Classes should be scheduled as follow:<br><br>
•	60% on Sun-Tue-Thu<br>
•	40% Mon-Wed<br>
•	10% from 08:00-09:00<br>
•	10% after 15:00<br>
•	A class start and end time should be the same for all days.<br>
•	Each college is kindly requested to utilize all days in a pattern to eliminate gaps. However the gaps can be utilized for labs and tutoring sessions.<br>
•	A class that meets once a week should not be scheduled in the peak hours (10:00 – 15:00). If it must, then the college is responsible for using the same block for other similar once a week
classes.<br><br>

</ul>

<strong>GOOD SCHEDULING PRACTICES</strong><br><br>

•	A course should be assigned a classroom which best meets the needs of the class to ensure the best teaching and learning experience for faculty and students.<br>
•	Review each classroom schedule to ensure that it is conflict free.
•	Draft several student schedule scenarios to ensure that students can register core courses and popular electives without any overlap.<br>
•	If a class is not needed, kindly cancel it as soon as possible and inform the registrar.<br>
•	Current semester enrolments, previous semesters' enrolments and the number of current students in a course can all be utilized in projecting the upcoming total enrolment for a course.<br>
•	Each college is strongly encouraged to plan for a reasonable number of classes that run simultaneously to make classroom assignments easier.<br><br>

<strong>LABORATORY AND TUTORIAL</strong><br><br>

Lab and tutorial schedules must be designed and submitted with course schedules to eliminate unforeseen class overlaps. Lab assignments are prioritized as follows:<br><br>
•	COS approval must be obtained to use a COS lab.<br>
•	COE has priority utilization for computer labs (SG.064 and B3.065).<br>
•	COM has priority utilization for the computer lab (BG.079); followed by COB and subsequently
COE and COS.<br><br>

<strong>Tips for Common Issues</strong><br><br>

Scheduling issues can be eliminated when detailed reviews are conducted. Below are some common issues and their suggested solutions.<br><br>

<strong>CLASSROOM RESERVATION</strong><br><br>

Classrooms can be used for teaching, workshops, seminars, exams and various other activities. The following are the points to be considered when reserving a classroom:<br><br>
•	A classroom reservation for any purpose prior to term commencement is not considered until all classes and their required sessions, such as tutorials and labs, are scheduled.<br>
•	A reservation request must be submitted at least one full working day in advance.<br>
•	A request to reserve three classrooms or more must be submitted at least three working days in advance<br><br>

                                       <strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>
 
<h3>Independent and Directed Study (IDS)</h3><br>
 

Independent and Directed Studies allow students to initiate, develop and complete courses under the supervision of a faculty member.<br><br>

The purpose of the IDS program is to allow students to:<br><br>

• 	Pursue learning outcomes that extend beyond those normally taught in the classroom.<br>
• 	Pursue studies independent of the classroom schedule.<br>
• 	Have prior learning recognized for a course they may not have completed.<br>
• 	A primary goal is to encourage independent study under the supervision of faculty members. In addition to research projects, internships and practicums, the different programs use individual study, case studies and directed readings as the basis for various independent study offerings.<br><br>

The student and the supervising faculty member develop the content and format of the Directed Study course. The program of reading, assignments and method of evaluation will be dependent on the subject under study. Supervision is also on an individual basis, and while there may not be regularly scheduled class sessions, the student is expected to schedule and maintain regular meetings with the IDS faculty member.<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br><br>

• 	An IDS course must be undertaken with a view to specified learning outcomes.<br>
• 	The course may be taken for variable credit and not more than twice and for no more than 6 credit hours. One, two or three credits of selected studies may be earned for each IDS course reported.<br>
IDS courses should not be taken to replace required courses.<br>
• 	The following requirements govern enrollment for credit in independent study:<br>

•	The consent of the instructor and college dean must be obtained before enrollment.<br>
•	The content of the study should differ from the content of the regular course offerings.<br>
•	The contact hours between student and faculty member must be sufficient to ensure consistency with credit earned in regular course offerings.<br>
•	Students must have at least junior standing (i.e., 3rd year), including transfer students, who
have earned at least a 2.75 cumulative GPA at Alfaisal University and who give sufficient evidence of initiative, originality and intellectual maturity to warrant the expectation of distinction in the program.  Students may do Independent Directed Studies in any discipline in which they obtain the required permission.<br><br>
 


<strong>Procedure:</strong><br><br>

•	Students wishing to take an independent directed study must complete the Directed Studies Application Form and have it approved by the faculty member most familiar with the topic of study and obtain further approval from the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled.<br>
•	The dean of the college may form a committee to recommend the approval at the college level.<br>
•	The faculty will work with the student to select a reading list, projects, and evaluations appropriate to the topic and the credit level chosen.<br>
•	All needed materials will be presented in a syllabus attached to the application form.<br><br>

<strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>
 
Transfer Credits<br><br>
 


The number of transfer credits a student receives depends primarily on the educational quality of the work and the comparability of the courses taken in content, scope, and level to those offered by the University.
<br><br>

The transfer credits of a student from outside the University may be accepted under the following policy:<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br><br>


•	The department head, and/or college dean determine if and how credit transfer may be used to satisfy baccalaureate requirements.<br>
•	All courses that are approved and evaluated by the concerned college will be added to transfer
database.<br>
•	New students should fill the transfer credit form and submit it with the admission form.<br>
•	A maximum of 40% of any program total credits may be applied toward the baccalaureate to be transferred.<br>
•	Credits Transfers must be approved initially by the prospective college in Alfaisal University, to
which the student is joining and the total number of Credit Hours must not exceed 48 credit hours. The process of credit transfer will begin after the acceptance to the college.<br>

•	Undergraduate course work completed at regionally accredited degree-granting institutions that is comparable in character, content, and quality to courses offered by the University and in which a minimum grade of "C " has been earned, will be considered for transfer credit. The student's quality point average at the University however, is calculated solely on the basis of work taken at Alfaisal University.<br>

•	Transfer credits are posted on the transcript and assigned the grade "CR"<br>

•	The number of transfer credits a student receives depends primarily on the educational quality of the work and the comparability of the courses taken in content, scope, and level to those offered by the University.<br>

•	Transfer course work is evaluated on an individual basis and assigned an equivalent University course number whenever possible. If no equivalent course can be designated, and the work is
 
deemed to be comparable to University-level work, then general elective credits in the discipline may be awarded.<br>

•	If a student fails to indicate on the admission application that s/he has completed course work at another college or university and later requests to have that work evaluated for transfer, credit for such work will be denied. Students can also be subject to dismissal for failure to disclose postsecondary institution enrollment.<br>

•	The Registrar Office requests that departments review and/or re-evaluate courses offered by public and private institutions so that Transfer Courses Data base may be kept up-to-date with new offerings, content change, etc. Colleges might also request additional review of Transfer Courses Database in accordance with College regulations and standards. In this regard, the Registrar Office makes students aware of regulations through the university website.<br><br>




<strong>Non-Transferable Credit</strong><br><br>

•	Credit earned in colleges and universities that are not regionally accredited.<br>
•	Courses on a transcript where no credit or grade is given.<br>
•	Career, vocational, or technical courses.<br>
•	Distance learning courses.<br>
•	Precollegiate/remedial courses; e.g., reading improvement, English/Math skills courses, developmental courses, or courses classified by as below freshman level or not
applicable to the degree, etc.<br>
•	Personal development/self-improvement courses; e.g., career counseling, interpersonal relationships, college success courses, etc.<br>
•	Courses not offered at the undergraduate level by the University.
•	Credit given by another college for life/work experience.<br>
•	Co-op, internship, and practicum credit.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Transfer Credit Evaluation</strong><br><br>

Official transfer credit evaluations are prepared only for students who:<br>

•	Have been admitted to a degree program and have paid the advance deposit fee.
•	Are continu<br>ing students taking school work away while still enrolled at the University Continuing students are request to receive prior approval for school work to be taken elsewhere.<br>

<br>

<strong>Procedure:</strong><br><br>


•	Transfer credit is administered by the Registrar.<br>
•	The Registrar Office works on a close and continual basis with one faculty member in each department, designated by the department head or dean of the College, who acts as liaison with the Registrar Office.<br>
 
<br>

<strong>AU current student:</strong><br><br>

•	Student must fill the transfer form and submit it with the syllabus to the college, he/she must be sure the course planned to take at the other university is on Alfaisal syllabus and approved by the college.

<strong>Incomplete Course</strong><br>

Introduction:<br><br>

Students are expected to complete all course work by the end of a semester. When this is not possible as a result of illness or other circumstances, an incomplete grade may be considered. The University distinguishes between two types of extensions: personal and academic. Only in the most unusual circumstances can an extension, either personal or academic, be granted.<br><br>



<strong>Personal Extensions</strong><br><br>

Personal extensions are appropriate for students coping with end-of-semester illness or other personal circumstances beyond their control.<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br><br>
•	In certain cases, the student may not wish this documentation to be placed in his or her student file. In this case, the student should confer confidentially with the relevant faculty member, and
with the agreement of the dean of the college, such material can be excluded from the student's
file.<br>
•	The due date for completed work will be set at the time the extension is granted. For the fall and spring semesters it is expected that all written work and projects will be completed no later than four weeks from the last day of exams. Earlier deadlines may be set by the instructor. The Dean of the College and the student will agree on the specified deadline.<br>
•	An incomplete (IC) grade will be given to the student if the instructor is unable to submit the final exam before the final grade deadline and submit a Grade Change Authorization Form to the
College Dean for approval and processing to the Office of the Registrar.<br><br>



<strong>Procedure:</strong><br><br>
•	Request forms for these extensions are available from the Office of Registrar.<br>
•	The Dean of the College will be required to receive and judge the validity of these requests.<br>
•	Documentation from a doctor, hospital or other appropriate institution is required in order to consider an extension. All documentation will be placed in the student's permanent academic record. This verification is required to document circumstances that have had an impact on a student's ability to finish course work or finals.<br>
•	Students must submit all requests before the last day of classes.<br>
•	Faculty will submit extension grades no later than the fifth (5th) week following the last day of exams, unless special arrangements are made with the College Dean and the University Registrar.<br>
 
<br>


<strong>Academic Extensions</strong><br>

Academic extensions are appropriate when something non-personal interferes with a student's ability to complete work.<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br><br>
•	"Normal" computer failures are not covered by this policy; it is expected that students will back up their files.<br>
•	Only rarely will extensions be granted for academic reasons.<br>
•	The due date for completed work will be set at the time the extension is granted. The Instructor, the College Dean, and the student must agree in writing on the due date.<br><br>

<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br><br>


•	Student evaluations and assignments of final course grades are the responsibility of the faculty.<br>
The faculty member is accountable for any grades assigned to students; therefore, each faculty member shall maintain records to support student evaluations and grades. Students who have reasons which can be substantiated to request grade changes must:<br>
•	Write a formal letter to the Instructor (or to the Dean of the College if the instructor is no longer on campus) requesting a re-evaluation of their performance in the course.<br>
•	Provide the following information in the letter: name and student ID, course number, title,
and section; semester and year taken; name of the Instructor and a clear statement of the grade change request and reasons which justify the request.<br><br>



<strong>Procedure:</strong><br>

•	Faculty members, upon receiving student's request for a grade change, will review their records.<br>
If it is determined that a student's request is justified, the faculty member will prepare a Grade Change Authorization Form, with appropriate documentation and submit it to the Dean for authorization. The grade change is forwarded to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may not change an F grade to a W grade in those cases in which the student did not follow the proper procedures for withdrawing from the course.
•	The Grade Change Authorization Form should be send to in a confidential way to the registrar office.<br>

<h3>Final Grade Appeal</h3>



<strong>Introduction:</strong><br>

The Alfaisal University Academic Appeals Process is designed to maintain the integrity and quality of each College's programs within the University and to ensure that a fair and equitable learning and teaching environment is upheld for all students and faculty.<br><br>

<strong>Policy:</strong><br>

The student can appeal a negative decision of a faculty member; this policy is intended for students who believe that they have legitimate grounds for requesting a reassessment of their final grade on a course.

<br><br>
<br>
<strong>Procedure:</strong>

Present the appeal to the faculty member's College Dean who refers the appeal to a committee for hearing
and decision.
Based on committee decision, college dean will authorize a grade change, and must notify the involved individual of his action, i.e., the College Dean must notify the student, the faculty member and the
registrar office of his decision.
To appeal an attendance-related grade reduction, the appeal process that is part of the Attendance Policy must be followed.
